# Side Projects

Extremely brief readme:

1. Prophecy Bot: generates funny little prophecies based off the bible. Works in a neat little tkinter program. You'll need to train the gpt2 model yourself on the included dataset, the plaintext of the entire Jewish bible (~old testament), or your favorite other data, to get the "smart" bits to work. I've included a little script to do that, which I probably stole from stackexchange.
2. Folk Bot: generates fake folk songs with playable chords based on the bands 'The Mountain Goats' and 'AJJ'. Saves the songs out as an image. If you play one, please send me a recording haha

Both originally pushed content out to twitter.com/ajjbot1 but I've removed the api details from the code here.

cheers!
