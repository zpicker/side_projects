Bullshit math equations

Im not a courageous man.

Too cowardly to take a stand,

I want to keep my nose clean.

The first month after you left

I drank and jerked off 'til I slept

And I know this won't last forever

But goddammit it feels like forever

This songwriting process is modeled after Brian Wilson

Shuffling around in sweatpants mumbling
Cadd9            D             G        G/F#     C      D
So much would go wrong when he tried to make his songs

Don't be afraid to speak in your native tongue

The grandson of a ghost is singing me to tell a song

  Don't know if I believe in god

Cause I think you deserve much more than a smoke and 50 cents
    Em                C                        D       Am

Well I'm sure they'll feel so much better with the illusion

that they are helping out those sinners
             C             D                           G
when all they really do is buy those so called sinners shitty dinners

Like 5 dollar Hot and Ready pizzas and high fructose corn syrup punch

When little kids get hit by cars,
F        G         C   
Girl you know it's true.
F        G      C
Darling, I love you.
C
I've been tryin' to move on, 
C
since you left, Since you've been gone,
    F       G       C
but it's so hard on me.
C
Talked to a girl in first hour,
C
bought her a cd, Bought her a flower,
    F       G      C
but she's a stupid cunt.
    F            G          C            Am
But I'll take anything, and I'll take anyone.
     F             G       C             Am
I'll take an angry lesbian with a loaded gun.
     F                 G            C         Am
I'll take a whore with syphilis and gonorrhea too.
    F        G      C        
But darling, I love you.
   C
Oh I hate my brain
            Am             F
Because the things I think sometimes
            C
Are so judgemental and lame
         Am           F                
I've got everything I want except
   G
My set of expectations
      Am       F
Won't stay the same
       G
Then I really really hate my brain
C         F
I hate my brain
          C
I hate my brain
C                    
I used to be a spiderman
  Am           F          
I used to be a cowboy 
C
from hell

But not anymore
Am             F
Now I'm just a clam
      G
And I live inside this shell
            Am      F
Inside this shell I am
       G
Oh god damn I hate my brain
C         F
I hate my brain 
          C
I hate my brain
              F               
And there’s a guy in a(sars?) mask
C                G
Walking down the street screaming
F                         C
The fourth time I've seen something like that
     G
This week
      F
And I just can't shake 
  C                 Am
I cannot shake that feeling
         G
That one day that man in the mask will be me
C         F
I hate my brain
          C
I hate my brain
   C
Oh I hate my brain
            Am             F
Because the things I think sometimes
            C
Are so judgemental and lame
         Am           F                
I've got everything I want except
   G
My set of expectations
      Am       F
Won't stay the same
G
Man I really hate my brain
C         F

          Am
I hate my brain
          G
I hate my brain
          C (hold and fade)
I hate my brain
  Am                E7              Am
I found a small red boy inside my tummy
C                   G                   C
  With 3 dollars in change and a Milky Way Lite
      E7                                          Am
In my occasional pursuit to find something more meaningful
     F                                  G
Than yet another word that rhymes with "die"
  Am              E7             Am
I cut him out and put him on my table
    C                 G                     C
His shallow-breathing chest would fall and rise
    E7                                 Am
His South of Heaven shirt was way too big for him
    F
His horns were long and sharp
            G
And then he opened up those eyes that said
  C           G            Am
I am, I am, I am, I am the truth
Am E7
,
  Am                E7           Am     
I showered him with love and adulation
C              G               C
One day he was just as tall as me
  E7                                  Am
I showed him all the books that I was raised on
     F                         G
Your Madeleine L'Engle and D'Aulaires' Mythologies
         Am                 E7                Am      
And in a montage that could warm the heart of Hitler
  C                G                  C
I raised him up so proud and motherly
  E7                              Am
I swore that I was glancing in a mirror
            F                                   
When in the language that I taught him
        G
Oh god, he began to speak, he said
  C           G            Am
I am, I am, I am, I am the truth
  C           G            Am
I am, I am, I am, I am the truth
        F                       G
And his eyes became a beacon, an LCD projector
     E7                           F
Broadcasting all my memories in a clear and vivid picture
    F                              G
His tongue became a staircase, his uvula the knocker
      E7                             F
Of an ornate wooden door that led me straight into my future
    F                               G
His throat became a hallway with a thousand baby pictures
    E7                           F
And I became forgiveness, I transformed into the closure that I lost
F                           G       
   When I learned about the tragedy of all of us 
  E7                               F
I lost it when I learned about the tragedy of all of us
  F                         G
Incorrigible illness in the loved ones in and out of us
  E7                               F
I lost it when I learned about the tragedy of all of us
  F                                G
I walked through the hallways to a room of only mirrors
E7                            F
Reflecting me in bondage so I watched myself get freer
  F
I let my horns grow longer
   G
I observed my skin get redder
   Am
My soul became a hammer
   C
I started to feel better
   F
My hatred to turned to pity 
   G
My resentment blossomed flowers
   C              E7
My bitter tasted candy
   Am           G
My misery was power
    F
The truth in me grew brighter
   G
My nature and my nurture 
        C              G             Am
No more shame, no more fear, no more dread!
  F           G            C
I am, I am, I am, I am the truth
C                                F
  and I broke my promise on a very sharp rock
    C                  G
and I was possessed by something quite unfriendly
    C     G            Am          F
and I was haunted by a demon in my sleep
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
    C                  F
and I gave a beer to a bum that was drinking
    C                       G
and I gave some sauce to my bestest friend for cooking
    C      G        Am                 F
and I gave water to all I thought were thirsty
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
    C                      F
and I gave my money to the bank for safe keeping
    C                     G
and I gave my money to my landlord, he was needing it
    C      G                Am          F
and I gave attention to the TV that was bleeding
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
       C
If you ain't got the do re mi boys
       C                   G
If you ain't got the do re mi
           C                           F
Well you'd better go back to beautiful Texas
    C             G              C
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
    C
California is a garden of Eden
  C                      F
a paradise to live in or see
      C           G              Am         F
but believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
       C             G     C
If you ain't got the do re mi
    C                       F
and we totally ripped off a man named Woodie Guthrie
    C                     G
and I bought a restaurant for his son named Alice
    C     G          Am            F
and I fed false information to the audience
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
    C                        F
and I give a thank you to my father for not raising me
    C                         G
and I give a finger to my stepfather for beating me
    C      G        Am         F
and I give props to myself for achieving
   C        G              C
goddamn I'm glad that I survived
   C         G                   C
goddamn I am surprised that I survived
    C                   F
and I just handed you a giant load of gibberish
    C                G
and I give love to a lover quite deserving of it
    C      G         Am             F
and I give thanks to all of you for listening
         C               G                 C

Well, once when I was eight
     E
everything was going great
            C                      F
until my father, he tried to kill me.
        Am  
By the time that I was nine,
     E
my daddy was doing time,
         C                           F
and my mother had enlisted in the army.
   Am          G                 C
I wish my father had loved me more.
       Am
By the time was that I was ten
          E
my dad's life was going to end
        C                   F
'cause he was going on ninety.
        Am
By the time I was eleven
    E
my daddy was up in heaven
       C                        F
in the clouds, staring down at me.
       Am         G           C
And I can't help but miss him 
       Am       G             C
Even though he hit me everyday.
        Am       G                   C
And he tried to hang me with a belt once.
        Am             G            C
And he took nude photographs of my body.
            C                                                 Am
And by the time that I was twelve, I had made my first million.
            C                                                  Am
And by the time that I was fourteen, I had found the cure to cancer.
            C                                                   Am
And by the time that I was fourteen, I was the president of the country

And by the time that I was fifteen, I was the champion of the world.
         Am       G              C
So I'm glad my daddy didn't love me.

And I'm glad that he tried to kill me.
         Am       G                  C
And I'm glad he took those pictures of me.
      Am       G               C

I knew a woman once
        Am
giving birth to kittens and mice
    C                       Em
And as you know, with their eating habbits
       C                D
Those poor mice had to die
       G
So the kittens were born
 Am
full of their brothers and sisters
     C                    Em
And they were punished swiftly
            C             D
though they did not know why
Em    C                G
They thought they were food
Em            C                G
they did not know what they'd done
    G
And I was a person once
 Am
sending off unread letters
  C            Em
receiving no reply
        C               D
never bothering asking why
G
I had a heart once
Am
full of fire and passion
          C             Em          C   D
but the summer took it away from me
     Em         C        G
And autumn has come to retrieve it
 Em         C          G
Autumn has come to retrieve it
    G
And I was a man once
     Am
When I was six years old
     C              Em
but now I am just a boy
    C                      D
pretentious and brash and bold
    G
The kittens were murdered
Am
thrown into burlap sacks
    C                   Em
and weighted down with rocks
     C               D
in a river deep and black

And th - ey went to Heaven.

There will come a day when our cells won't regenerate

Once an hour a day I get very sad

Once an hour a day I get depressed

When that hour is over I start to feel okay
C                         G         D
because I'm reminded I'll rot away, rot away.
Em                G       C                 D
I don't have much time to hang out here and cry
Em                       G      C             D
and though that may feel nice I can't do that every day
G                                     D
I've had a lot of friends and they've done a lot of drugs
          C                         G         D
and those drugs made my friends rot away, rot away
G                             D
They say that Jesus saves but Jesus doesn't care
        C                      G           D
because he is in a grave, in a grave, in a grave
Em               G         C                         D

    D                                   C               G
and though it seems that I can't win, I think I have to try
                                 Am
everyone's afraid of me, they'll never see that we all bleed

the same damn blood each night
   Am        C            G    ?  Em

And sense and sensibility and peaceful productivity
  D                                C            G
a pretty girl with broken wings is all that I desire
                                 Am
but there's so much hostility in all the things surrounding me
    D                       C                 G
the awful glow of enmity is trying to stop my shine
                             Am
so I try to look inwardly at all the things inside of me
    D                       C                 G
but sodomy and buggery keep bubbling to the top
   Am        C           G    ?  Em
so you'll go forward and I'll go back
          C                  D            G
I hope we catch up with each other on the track

the perfect human being Jesus lived without sin

,
          G
The first month after you left
  Em
I drank and jerked off 'til I slept
          C          D
I went to work when I had to
             G
And then came home
          G
I fed the dog when I had to
        Em
I fed myself when I had to
            C           D
Went out of town when I had to
             G
And then came home
      C                       D
And I know this won't last forever
       G                       Em                  
But goddammit it feels like forever
                    C
Since we've been together
                Cm
'Til we'll be together again

The second month after you left
  Em
I still felt real depressed
             C               D
But I've got plenty of other things
             G
To spend my time on
       G
I hate whiny fucking songs like this
      Em
But I can't afford a therapist
C           D
Sorry guys
          G
Here's a solo
         C                D
And it's harder to be yourself
        G              Em   
Than it is to be anybody else
C            D                G
I wish I was someone closer to you
      C                       D
And I know this won't last forever
       G         D            Em

G                           Cadd9         D          G
This songwriting process is modeled after Brian Wilson
G                   Cadd9       D      G
Shuffling around in sweatpants mumbling
Cadd9            D             G        G/F#     C      D
So much would go wrong when he tried to make his songs
G                         Cadd9  D     G
And I'm not that big of a fan of Brian Wilson
G                                Cadd9      D       G
My favorite Beach Boys songs are written by Charles Manson
Cadd9       D                   G     G/F#   C                                      D
"Wild Honey Pie", "Why Don't We Do It In The Road"... No wait, I think that was The Beatles?
G           Cadd9         D           G
Every day I try to do the things that feel alright
       G              Cadd9               D
And no matter what, I feel like a bastard deep inside
       G              D                  G      G/F#     C                   D
French Quarter to the bullshit, cut your losses and play bass, and listen to CCR
        C                 D
Keep on chooglin, keep on keepin' on,
         G         G/F#                 Em
Don't be afraid to speak in your native tongue
    C                              D
The grandson of a ghost is singing me to tell a song
           G                  G/F#           Em
And all my dead friends in my corner now are cheering me along
   C                                     D
If it's inside your head, don't let them tell you that you're wrong
        G                 G/F#             Em

It's made by children for the immature.
C          F                     Am             Em
It is made by babies who've been captured.

It's a sin against your fellow man.

                  F  G
Don't worry about it
                   C
Just stay on the couch
                    G
Judge whatever people do
                       Am
Don't do anything for yourself
                             F   G
I'd hate to see it happen to you
F                G         Am   C
If that's what gets your dick hard
   F                     G           Am
Telling people they're bad at making art
     F                  G              Am  C
Feeling just like you're the one in charge
     F         G             C
Pissing on my most pathetic parts 
G                                                                      Em
If I had a cigarette for every time a perfect stranger asked me for a cigarette
                     C                                G
then I'd have enough cigarettes to get me through the day.
                   G                                                            Em
And if I had some spare change every time a perfect stranger asked me for some spare change
                     C                                                   D
then I'd have enough spare change to take care of these bills I need to pay.
            Em       C         D                   Em            C                Am
And dude I know that times are tough but that does not mean that you can have my stuff
               G                            Em
So how about a ride? I can drive you to the shelter
                         C                                    D
We can eat dinner at the Andre house and you can even take a shower
              Em  C             D                        Am
Cause I think you deserve much more than a smoke and 50 cents
    Em                C                        D       Am
You deserve to be self-sufficient and buy your own cigarettes

They will feed you so much pizza that you'll forget about the rut that you are in
G                                                                          C

G                                  D               C
Well I'm sure they'll feel so much better with the illusion
              D                 G
that they are helping out those sinners
             C             D                           G
when all they really do is buy those so called sinners shitty dinners
              C                             D
Like 5 dollar Hot and Ready pizzas and high fructose corn syrup punch
      G                      C
You diabetic and apathetic, wondering when they will bring you lunch 
       G                  C            G         D        G     
to the park they keep you in, when the saints go marching in
                  G                                                           Em
So I wish I had a cigarette for every time a perfect stranger asked me for a cigarette
                    C                     Cm                     G
but I wonder what a cigarette will really do to help that person out
         G                                                                                 Em
I wish to God I had some spare change for every time a perfect stranger asked me for some spare change
                             C                      Cm                         G
but there's not enough spare change in the world to make such an empty gesture count.

         Am                 E7                Am      
And in a montage that could warm the heart of Hitler
  C                G                  C
I raised him up so proud and motherly
  E7                              Am
I swore that I was glancing in a mirror
            F                                   
When in the language that I taught him
        G
Oh god, he began to speak, he said
  C           G            Am
I am, I am, I am, I am the truth
  C           G            Am
I am, I am, I am, I am the truth
        F                       G
And his eyes became a beacon, an LCD projector
     E7                           F
Broadcasting all my memories in a clear and vivid picture
    F                              G
His tongue became a staircase, his uvula the knocker
      E7                             F
Of an ornate wooden door that led me straight into my future
    F                               G
His throat became a hallway with a thousand baby pictures
    E7                           F
And I became forgiveness, I transformed into the closure that I lost
F                           G       
   When I learned about the tragedy of all of us 
  E7                               F
I lost it when I learned about the tragedy of all of us
  F                         G
Incorrigible illness in the loved ones in and out of us
  E7                               F
I lost it when I learned about the tragedy of all of us
  F                                G
I walked through the hallways to a room of only mirrors
E7                            F
Reflecting me in bondage so I watched myself get freer
  F
I let my horns grow longer
   G
I observed my skin get redder
   Am
My soul became a hammer
   C
I started to feel better
   F
My hatred to turned to pity 
   G
My resentment blossomed flowers
   C              E7
My bitter tasted candy
   Am           G
My misery was power
    F
The truth in me grew brighter
   G
My nature and my nurture 
        C              G             Am
No more shame, no more fear, no more dread!
  F           G            C
I am, I am, I am, I am the truth
C                                F
  and I broke my promise on a very sharp rock
    C                  G
and I was possessed by something quite unfriendly
    C     G            Am          F
and I was haunted by a demon in my sleep
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
    C                  F
and I gave a beer to a bum that was drinking
    C                       G
and I gave some sauce to my bestest friend for cooking
    C      G        Am                 F
and I gave water to all I thought were thirsty
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
    C                      F
and I gave my money to the bank for safe keeping
    C                     G
and I gave my money to my landlord, he was needing it
    C      G                Am          F
and I gave attention to the TV that was bleeding
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
       C
If you ain't got the do re mi boys

Well you'd better go back to beautiful Texas

Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
    C
California is a garden of Eden
  C                      F
a paradise to live in or see

If you ain't got the do re mi

and we totally ripped off a man named Woodie Guthrie
    C                     G
and I bought a restaurant for his son named Alice
    C     G          Am            F
and I fed false information to the audience
C            G                 C
that's how I learned how to survive
    C                        F
and I give a thank you to my father for not raising me
    C                         G
and I give a finger to my stepfather for beating me
    C      G        Am         F
and I give props to myself for achieving
   C        G              C

and I just handed you a giant load of gibberish
    C                G
and I give love to a lover quite deserving of it

Well, once when I was eight

everything was going great
            C                      F
until my father, he tried to kill me.
        Am  
By the time that I was nine,
     E
my daddy was doing time,
         C                           F
and my mother had enlisted in the army.
   Am          G                 C
I wish my father had loved me more.
       Am
By the time was that I was ten
          E
my dad's life was going to end
        C                   F
'cause he was going on ninety.
        Am
By the time I was eleven
    E
my daddy was up in heaven
       C                        F
in the clouds, staring down at me.
       Am         G           C
And I can't help but miss him 
       Am       G             C
Even though he hit me everyday.
        Am       G                   C
And he tried to hang me with a belt once.
        Am             G            C
And he took nude photographs of my body.
            C                                                 Am
And by the time that I was twelve, I had made my first million.
            C                                                  Am
And by the time that I was fourteen, I had found the cure to cancer.

I will buy us an acre

Of some land in the city
         Am         G
We could live there together

I knew a woman once
        Am
giving birth to kittens and mice
    C                       Em
And as you know, with their eating habbits
       C                D
Those poor mice had to die
       G
So the kittens were born
 Am
full of their brothers and sisters
     C                    Em
And they were punished swiftly
            C             D
though they did not know why
Em    C                G
They thought they were food
Em            C                G
they did not know what they'd done
    G
And I was a person once
 Am
sending off unread letters
  C            Em
receiving no reply
        C               D
never bothering asking why
G
I had a heart once
Am
full of fire and passion
          C             Em          C   D
but the summer took it away from me
     Em         C        G
And autumn has come to retrieve it
 Em         C          G
Autumn has come to retrieve it

but now I am just a boy
    C                      D
pretentious and brash and bold
    G
The kittens were murdered
Am
thrown into burlap sacks
    C                   Em
and weighted down with rocks

because I'm reminded I'll rot away, rot away.

They say that Jesus saves but Jesus doesn't care

Because people are the greatest thing to happen

People are people regardless of creed

And people are my religion because I believe in them

People are my enemies and people are my friends

         C            F             C           G      (X)
because God created puppy dogs and God created kittens,

and our love creates a power plants

that generates this world,

I had a dream
Am    C  Em
I had a dream tonight
Am             C       Em
That I cut off a piece of the baby Jesus
Am     C    Em
To offend my friends
Am             Em               C
But the joke misfired, yes it did oh yes it did
Am             Em                C
Cause the piece of the baby I cut off it bled and it bled
Am    C  Em
I tried everything
Am    C  Em
I tried bandages and shit
Am    C  Em
I tried praying to it
Am    C  Em
But all to no avail
Am               Em                C
Nothing could keep the baby Jesus from bleeding
Am                Em                    C
Oh no, nothing would keep the baby Jesus from bleeding
Am      C      Em
I got to stop having these dreams
Am    C  Em
They are killing me inside
Am    C  Em
They are killing me alive
Am    C  Em
They are ruining my soul
Am                     Em                  C
But nothing could keep these dreams from hurting me

No no, nothing could keep these dreams from fucking me up

And then the worst thing happened
Am    C  Em
The baby opened his eyes
Am    C  Em
And he stared into mine
Am    C  Em
And he started to speak
Am                                Em                        
He said listen boy I'm gonna throw you in hell

And he's thirsty for blood

Times when I'd be filled with shame

Over things that everybody goes through

But now I'm free

Times when the rage inside me swells

Into a big black tidal wave

And I feel like an idiot
Em
But I know who I can deal with it

              Am                                     E
Because their hair gel that they use isn't tested on animals

And their swallow tattoos are fucking lame

So fucking straightedge getting high off of self-righteousness

So urban, so infantile, so angry, so young, and so poor

And how do we maintain our buoyancy in this
Am                                 D   
Salty lake of shit and tears and murder and disease?
    Em     C      G         D       Em       Am   Em
How do we keep ourselves afloat in all this sad stuff?

I've gotta know the answers I've gotta know it now.

And I need to know the answers I have to know how.

We'll all die alone someday, I hope we don't die alone.
