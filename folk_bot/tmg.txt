and i'd be lying if i said i didn't feel the pull, too

but the sunlight makes me strong and i know about you

And this is a song for your young men to sing when they run out of options
F               G         C
Yeah, when they run out of options
C
There's the faith you can give or withhold

And then there's the one true faith

There's the revolution you came for

And the one you're eventually going to get
               F                                    Am
And there's a road that starts right here and leads clear up to Saskatchewan
       F              G           C
And I brought a full tank and a '67 Mustang
C                          F               G
And this is a song for your young women to whistle
              C          F           G        C
While they're driving at high speeds down the highway
C
There's wind up in the trees

There's a song on the wind

There's a message in the song

But the message is hopelessly complicated
        F
And the words are written on water
          Am
And they disappear before you write them down
    F    G           C
But I, I brought the Polaroid
C
And this the song
    Am
And everybody's got sing along
                         F
But it hasn't got a chorus
     G       C
God damn it all
C                   F         G         C
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

And a baseball cap holding down her black hair.

And she came here after midnight.

Some were dead on their feet.

turn toward the camera and smile, smile, smile.

when we ditched the plan to poison all our enemies,

stuffed our weapons in a clearing, and covered them with leaves,

 Unfurl the black velvet alter cloth,

Laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark

  C                       F              C                     F

i got sugar in the fuel lines both of us do

And we try to keep our sprits high

But they flag and they wane

When the truck pulls up out front

In the light spring rain

Like a killer through the curtain
C                    D                         F
And when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden

Yeah when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden

We keep up the good fight
                    G
We keep our spirits light
         C*        F
But they draw like flies
                               D   F   
And there's a stomach-churning shift
                    G
In the way the land lies
         C*        F
And they lean like towers
     D                     F 
On a hillside struggling to stand
                                  G

Without giving your mom a slice of pie
A                                   C

Look in the cellar where the cinders blaze
F                             G
Sift through the shadows for days
C                             F
Look in the corners, but you can't see me
G                     C
You can't see me I'm free

Count up the keepsakes in the cabinets
F                                G
The keyboards and the chemistry sets
C                            F
Look in the attic where the blinds are drawn

You won't find me I'm gone

I'm gonna blow the whole circus apart
C                              F
Reckon the remnants when they land at last
     F                          G
The shattered aftermath of the blast
C                            F
Look for me everywhere the burn marks form
  G                             C
Trying to find a place to keep warm

The jacaranda are wet with color,
        G                            D
and the heat is a great paint brush, lending color to our lives,
     G                                C
to the air, and to out faces; but I'm going to Alaska
              G                         D
where there's snow to suck the sound out from the air.
G       C
Up, yes, in the branches,
G                       D
the purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;
         G                              C
there is moaning in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them traces
G                           D
of last year, but then they hadn't grown so strong,
G                                    C
and their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables.
G                           D                    G
thick and alive with alien electricity, and I am going to Alaska,
     C                         G
where you can go blind just by looking at the ground,
D
where fat is eaten by itself
C                         G
just to keep your body warm.
G                         C
Because from where we are now, it seems, really,
    G                           D
that everything is growing in a thousand different ways;
G                                        C
that the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives
G                                           D
who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise
G                                C
to what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise?
     G                          D
I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you,
        G                     C
but they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them,
        G                         D
then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska.
C                                     G
They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes.
G 
I looked you up and down 
F6
I liked everything I saw 
G 
From the fragile outline of your hips
F6
To the trembling movement in your jaw
G                                        Gmaj7
But when the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor
F                          C
You said that you couldn't take it anymore
G
I knew you were leaving
F                     C       G
I knew you were going to Bristol
G
I watched you pack your bags
F6
I saw you head out to the door
G
But when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock
F6
You said that you couldn't take it anymore
G                                      Gmaj7
That was the second time you said that in one day
F                              C
Why don't you just sit still, it's going to be OK
G
Going to Bristol
F                     C       G
I knew you were going to Bristol

the most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you

        C                     Gsus4                    F6  
and you smile as you ease the gun from my hand and i'm frozen with joy right where i stand
          Gsus4                  G
the world throws its light underneath your hair

when you eased down the window

the constellations aligned
C                          G                        F
and as we crossed over the throgs neck bridge i had

something on my mind

and slowly, surely

i saw the whole story unwind
C                          G                        F
i had never loved anyone like i loved you

C               G     F
The ghostly sing-song

Of the children playing double-dutch

There was a barn owl trapped in the rafters.
G               D                    G     G
The ground underneath us was wet and cold.
   G                        D
We heard the owl thrashing about,
       G                  C
Trying desperately to get out.
G           D                            G     G
We stood outside and watched the night unfold.
G              D              G        G
We watched the sun go down on Scotland,
G                 G                 D    D
and I watched the moon come up over you.
G                                 G
When a pack of dogs went silently past us,
C                            C
We knew we'd been given fair warning,
G                D             G     G
but that was the only thing we knew.
G                      D                    G      G
And you threw all your luggage out onto the water.
G              D                  G     G
And I tore the shirt away from my back.
G                                 D
The cold came on with a new found in-tensity,
G                               C
And you pressed your warm body against me.
G                  D                     G     G
And I loved you so much it was making me sick.
G                  D              G         G
And we watched the sun go down on Scotland,
G                      G               D     D
We were glad that we'd left Oklahoma behind.

I took your hips in my hands and I threw you down

To the new found rich brown deep wet ground.

there was the sound of a lake boiling over

on that day.

everyone said just to sit still,

so the hook's been baited now,

yeah, the cheese is on the water.
C
yeah, all the water's been cleansed of all impurities,

         Em             D
Up there choking on his tears
G

G                      C
Let all the trash rain down
                   Em D
From way up in the rafters
            G                  C
I’m walking out of here in one piece
                      Em D    G
Don’t care what comes after
          C
Drive the wedge
          Em
Torch the bridge
  D                    C
I don’t want to die in here
  D                    G       
I don’t want to die in here
       G
Well they come and pull me from my house
                                  C
And they drag my body through the streets
                                  D              C
And the sun’s so hot I think I’ll catch fire and burn up
                               G
in the summer air so moist and sweet
                               G
And the people all come out to cheer
                              C
Rocks in the pathway break my skin
                               D            C
And there’s honeysuckle on the faint breeze today
                              G
With every breath I’m drawing in
          Em                 C
I want to cry out but I don’t scream and I don’t shout
           G              C
And I feel so proud to be alive
           G  D                 C
And I feel so proud to when the reckoning arrives
                          G
Crowds grow denser by the second
                             C
As we near the center of the town
                                   D                 C
And they dig a trench right in the main square right there
                                 G
And they pick me up and throw me down
                            G
And I start laughing like a child
                              C
And I mark their faces one by one
                       D              C
Transfigurations gonna come for me at last
                                G
And I will burn hotter than the sun
         Em                     C
I waited so long and now I taste jasmine on my tongue
           G              C
And I feel so proud to be alive
           G  D              C
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives

We all woke up that morning
Am                  C
Claw marks on our little faces
G                        Em
The dull thud from the treetops
C                 D7
The echo in the hollow places
C                  G
Rose up high and lonely
C                     G
Wringing my hands, grinding my teeth
Em                  G
All the triumph overhead
          C  D           G
All the disaster underneath
G
Spat out my morning prayers
Am                     C
Desperate pleas and vicious lies
G                               Em
Felt the sunlight through the grating
C              D7
Covered up my eyes
C                 G
Woke up feeling awful
C                             G
Shook my head to drive the ghosts way
Em                  G
This is just a flesh wound
C                         D
And it will clear up any day
            C                            G
But the present i got planned for you pricks
C                      D7
Is gonna be a little harder to fix
G         C
Thank god

In high doses

Heard the voices through the air vents
Am                   C
Listen to them squeal
G                               Em
The great big world is out there
C                          D7
The hidden one beneath my heel
C                            G
Called up my sister in Reseda
C                         G
Left a message at the tone
Em                              G
All the points where contact fails us
            C  D               G
All of the dead spots in the zone
G
And the acid in my throat
Am            C
Every time i try to talk
G                                 Em
The songs that keep me up at night
C                  D7
Standing on that solid rock
         C                     G
Rose up high and dry and lonely
 C                           G
Stumbled coming out the gate
Em                 G
This is just a paper cut
C                       D
And it will scab over just you wait
         C                               G
But the cuts that i'll shortly being dealing out

    I heard the wings beat on the wind tonight 
C              G                     Am
    As the heat stole power from the darkening light. 
F              G                   C                 F
    I saw the streets fill up with people that I knew,

    People who looked like you.

    Drift through the streets, walk between the cars
    C                G              Am
    Newborn sons and daughters spat forth from distant stars
F                     G              C                          F  
    The summer will reveal itself to those whose hearts are true
F                   G            
    And to the faithless few
Am                     F               Am

C            G                      C               D
 Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim?
       Em                         G
It was their love you wanted, not mine
                C                  D
But when they deny your name three times

Crawling around, down on the ground

 And I will throw you across my shoulders

 And I will bleed and I will drool
Em        D                C             G
 And the cameras will slow pan across my face
Em          F                    D
 And I will try to say something cool
G            Bm                   C              G

 Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun

 Who will that guy be holding you so high above them?

 You know and I know, everyone knows it, I'm the one

I may have failed you once before

Higher than weather balloons

Empty hearts on fire

Ready to drown

Nobody in this house

And the tears roll down my face

Till my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet
Em          G
In come the cops

They blowtorch the doors
Em      G
I start wailing

The lion roars
Em                     G
There's no good way to end this

Anyone can see

There's this great big you

Feed the kittens in the kitchen

Set food out for the strays

Try hard to do your best

The magpie will have his way

Face hidden from my view

Half rising to a crouch

In your walking keep your head low

A bad dream shook me in my sleep
Am7                  Dm
And I woke up sweating.

Ran through the dark to the shower,

Already forgetting.

Tried to think good thoughts.

Traced pictures on the mirror.

Squint your eyes and hope real hard,

Maybe sprout wings.
Dm                                    G5
I clawed my way to the living room window,
Am7                     Dmin
Stood there in the cold.
                                G5
The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance,
A#5     A
Hard to hold.

I thought of old friends,

The ones who'd gone missing like you
Am7                             Dmin
Said all their names three times.
                G5
Phantoms in the early dark,
A#5             A
Canaries in the mines.

Ghosts and clouds

and nameless things.
Dm                              G5        
Squint your eyes and hope real hard,

                       C          G           D
Come and stay with me out here away from things
                                 G            C
Come and stay with me where the sky's real clear
D                            C                       G
I live way out where no one believes anybody could live
D                            C                        G
Sky's purple from six in the evening 'till midnight out here
                  A          D       G
Stay 'till the world goes down in flames
                 C                   D
I've got room, room in my house for you
C                          G
Cool air comes through the venetian blinds
Em                               F
And the planets and the heavens are perfectly aligned
C                          G
I take in my surroundings, I memorize them all
Em
The scuff marks on the stone floor
F
The powder burns on the eastern wall
C                       G
There's a monkey in the basement
Em                      F
Where did the monkey come from
C                       G
There's a monkey in the basement
Em                            F
How did the monkey get there, how did the monkey get there
C                            G
How did the monkey get there
C                    G
The animal noises you used to make
Em             F
The andalusian coral snake
C                     G
All hail when standing beside this room
Em                     F
And the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom
G                       Em
I went down the the gas station
Asus2
for no particular reason,
G                            Em
heard the screams from the high school,
Asus 2
it's football season.
G                      Em
empty lot the station faces,
Asus2
will probably be there forever.
G                     Em
I climbed over the four foot fence,
Asus2
I was trying to sever the tether.
             D    Am
moon in the sky,
Em
cold as a stone
D                        Am
spend each night in your arms,
C
always wake up alone.
G                  Em
I lay down in the weeds,
Asus2
it was a real cold night.
G                               Em
I was happy until the overnight attendant
Asus2
switched on the floodlight.
G                                  Em
walking home I was talking to you under my breath,
Asus2
saying things I would never say directly.
G                        Em
I heard a siren on the highway up ahead.
Asus2
kinda wish they'd come and get me
              D         Am
frost on the sidewalk,
Em
white as a bone
D                       Am
tried to get close to you again,
C
always wake up alone.
Bm                        C
and as i was crossing our doorstep,
C                         G
i hesitated just a moment there.
Bm                  C
remembered the day we moved into our small house
C                               Am
'til the vision got to vivid to bear.
G                Em
you were almost asleep,
Asus2
halfway undressed
G                Em
i lay right down next to you
Asus2
held your head against my chest.
G                          Em
and a guy with any kind of courage
Asus2
would maybe stop to think the matter through
G                          Em
maybe hold you still and raise the question,
Asus2
instead of blindly holding on to you.
                     D     Am
but we crank up the heat
Em
and you giggle and moan,
D                       Am
spend all night in the company of ghosts,
C
always wake up alone
C C* F F
 champagne bubbled up through the neck of the bottle,
 C C* F F
 and sweet sounds came out through the radio.
 C C F F
 it was john Coltrane.
 C C* F F
 god damn it, i love john Coltrane!
 C C* F F
 you danced across the living room floor,
 C C* F F
 and you kissed me once and then you kissed me some more.
 C C* F F
 you had your arms around my neck and it felt real fine,
 C C* F F
 and then your ankle knocked up against mine.
 C C F F
 and resonating in my bones
 C C F F
 the precise crisp drumming of the late great Mr. Elvin Jones.
 C C* F F
 god damn it, i love john Coltrane!
         F                                      C
It's so good to learn that right outside your window
        Dm                                   A#
There's only friendly fields and open roads.
                 F                            C
And you'll sleep better when you think you've stepped back from the brink,
    Dm                                    A#
And found some peace inside yourself; lay down your heavy load.
           F
It gets alright
C               A#
    To dream at night.
          F               D#                 A#
Believe in solid skies and slate blue earth below.
             F                 C
But when you see him - you'll know.
      F                                 C
It's okay to find the faith to saunter forward;
           Dm                                         A#
There's no fear of shadows spreading where you stand.
                   F                             C
And you'll breathe easier just knowing that the worst is all behind you,
        Dm                                        A#
And the waves that tossed the raft all night have set you on dry land.
         F
It gets okay
C                 A#
    To praise the day.
           F                     D#                 A#
Believe in sheltering skies and stable earth beneath.
             F
But hear his breath come
            C
Through his teeth.
F    C  A#
Walk by faith,
     Dm     C           A#
Tell no-one what you've seen.
        F                                      C
It's so good to learn that from right here the view goes on forever;
           Dm 
And you'll never want for comfort,
           A#
And you'll never be alone.
        F              
See the sunset turning red,
           C                
Let all be quiet in your head.
Dm
    And look about:
        A#
All the stars are coming out.
     F      C
They shine
           A#
Like steel swords.
        F     D#
Wish me well
           A#
Where I go.
             F
But when you see me,
       C
You'll know.
G                            Am
we were drinking colorado bulldogs
G                  Am  
when inspiration struck  
G                   Am C
and we knew it was high time 
C                        D
for us to change our own luck
G                               Am 
we cracked a couple coca colas open 
G                                  Am               
mixed them up with vodka and some coffee liqueur 
G                                    Am           
poured in some cold milk, raised our glasses high to old friends
C                   D
my love for you is 98 percent pure.
        C                G      
but the 2 percent that remains
C                            D
has fried the circuits in my brain. 
G                    Am
I got out my smoking jacket
G                                 Am
you put on some fishnets and your smart black beret,
G                            Am
we cut quite a figure in the mirror 
C                       D
and then we were on our way.
G                       Am
Oh would that you would kiss me 
G                       A
with the kisses of your mouth.
G                                Am
Cause your mouth is sweeter than wine and has 
C                                   D
a more complicated history than the american south
C                      G
As the evening took us in 
C                                           D
you could've popped the tension with a safety pin.
G                          Am
we went down to pete brown chevrolet, 
G                        Am
cause pete brown satisfy all your new car needs.
G                       Am
we were nicely oiled by then 
C                                    D
our internal transponders picking up satellite feeds 
G                      Am
from well worn ancient places.  
G                         Am
our eager young sales rep handed us the keys
G                            Am
we drove about 3 quarters of a mile, 
C                              D
all that's left for us now are moments like these.
C                                G
we parked behind the high school away from the light 
C                                    D
and the flames climbed high into the night...
Em    C                         G                   Em
i hung pictures of you from every lamp post in town
C      G                                               Em   C
as the humidity climbed into numbers i don't care to repeat
G                                       Em
the air was heavy and the sky was alive
C                               G                        D
and the pacific starlight train wasn't due in till 11.45
D                     G
i thought about how cold you must be
D                     G
i thought about things i thought that i'd soon be forgetting
D                      G                          C
i thought of you up in canada as the lightning storm lit up
                    G     Em
all downtown redding
C          G                                            Em
there were teenagers in mini-trucks coming around every corner
        C                    G                              Em
you can taste the adrenaline, coming out through their skin
  C                    G
i came to the well-lit doorway of a sheet music store
Em     C                  G    
                              
   D
saw my face in the glass. sat down in the doorway and i settled in.
Am
Pull my mask so tight
Dm
  Till it pinches my skin.
F                  Am
  Nerves strung so high:
F                 G
  I am a mandolin
Am
 Jenny calls from Montana,
F
 She's only passing through.
C
 Probably never see her again, in this life, I guess,
G
 Not sure what I'm gonna do.
       F
Plug a night light in;
          Am
Leave the porch light on.
            F
Because the small dark corners
        Am
Have designs on me.
              G
Live like an outlaw,
               F
Clutching gold coins in his claw.
Am G/A F Am

Am
Room full of ambitious young policemen,
Dm
Everybody trying to make his mark.
        F                       C
I was a red dot blinking on the screen up overhead;
F                          G
   And then the room went dark.
Am
Dream of maybe waking up someday
    F
And wanting you less than I do.
C
    This is a dream, though:
G
    It's never gonna come true.
       F
Plug a night light in;
          Am
Leave the porch light on.
            F
Because the small dark corners
                   Am
Are establishing a colony.
             G
Live like an outlaw,
               F
Clutching gold coins in his claw.
Am G/A F Am G/A F F

Am
  Can't ever set aside the sweetness
       Dm
Of the days before the crews put up the border.
F                 Am
   Fields full of wet rain
F                                    G
  Cling tight to their memory forever.
Am
Think about Montana when I close my eyes;
F
  Possibly Jenny's headed east.
C
  Count a couple of stray hopes out loud;
G
  May their numbers one day be increased.
       F
Plug a night light in;
          Am
Leave the porch light on.
            F
Because the small dark corners
                   Am
Breathe like heavy animals.
              G
Live like an outlaw,
               F
Clutching gold coins in his claw.

                    Bm    F#                      Bm
but i couldn't remember i honestly could not remember
Eadd9          Badd11            Bm                 Em   
 and a package came for you today from the hunan province
G                A            Bm             Em  
 the postmark burning jetblack in the summer sun
    G        A                    Bm                       Em
 someone was changing someone was changing from the inside out
       Bm        F#     Bm
 and i turned around to face you
[Riff]
sweet peas in the garden, all in full bloom
[Riff]
and i thought i heard the traces of an old song murmuring in the room
        G                     A     Bm             Em
like a half-remembered conversation, i let it slip away
                    Bm    F#                      Bm
but i couldn't remember i honestly could not remember
Eadd9          Badd11            Bm                 Em   
 and a package came for you today from the hunan province

 the postmark burning jetblack in the summer sun

C                    G
I hope that our few remaining friends
F                    C
Give up on trying to save us
  C                      G
I hope we come up with a failsafe plot
        F                        C
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us
C                    G
I hope the fences we mended
F                           G
Fall down beneath their own weight
      C                        Am
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
  F                     G
I hope it's already too late
    C                                          Am
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here

Someday burns down
    F
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
                 G                  F
And I never come back to this town again
      G             C
In my life I hope I lie
         Am
And tell everyone you were a good wife
               C
And I hope you die
          G         C
I hope we both die
C                   G
I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
F                        C
I hope it bleeds all day long
    C                          G
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
     F                             C
Well we're pretty sure they're all wrong
C                       G
I hope it stays dark forever
F                      G
I hope the worst isn't over
    C                       Am
And I hope you blink before I do
  F                G
I hope I never get sober
      C
And I hope when you think of me years down the line
    Am
You can't find one good thing to say
      F
And I hope that if I found the strength to walk out
                              G
You'd stay the hell out of my way
     F                            G
I am drowning there is no sign of land
                    C
You are coming down with me
Am
hand in unlovable hand
               C
And I hope you die
          G        C
I hope we both die
 C
The glowing world, the bench backed up against the house
 C                                    F
The chicken coops, the darkness surrounding everything
 C
It was late and the night was moving slowly
 C                            G  C
We laid down on the ground because the world was lonely
  C
If you keep quiet it will stay like this forever
  C
If you'll just keep quiet it will stay like this forever
   F       C
I feel certain of it now
 C
And all the birds were sleeping in their perches   
         C
The little wind swaying birches
          F                                           
And the north American wild turkey 
                          C
that your father brought home
                       G
Woke up and came toward us
 C
And the moonlight and the turkey waking up
C
And the night air and the moonlight on your skin
C
And the moonlight and the turkey waking up
C                             F
And quiet yard and the turkey and the moon
      F
Unimaginable
      F
Unimaginable
      F
Unimaginable
   F  G    C
Unimaginable
   Em
Well, guy in a skeleton costume
G                         C
Comes up to the guy in the Superman suit
                        Em
Runs through him with a broadsword

I flipped the television off
      G                    C
Bring all the bright lights up
               Em
Turn the radio up loud
A
 I don't know why I'm so persuaded
D
 That if I think things through
C
Long enough and hard enough
B
 I'll somehow get to you
             Em
But then you came in and we locked eyes
    A
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
           C
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
B
 And quickly lit another
Em
Look at that

Would you look at that?
A
 We're throwing off sparks
Em          D         A          Em
What will I do when I don't have you
                       G    Em
To hold onto in the dark?
     Em
Yes, everybody's gonna need a witness
G                             C
Everybody's gonna need a little back up
                       Em
In case the scene gets nasty

You throw the attic window open
      G                      C
And I throw myself all around you
                        Em
And night comes to Tallahassee
A                                   D
 I don't know why it's gotten harder to keep myself away
C
Thought I'd finally beat the feeling back
B
 It all came back today
            Em
And then we fell down and we locked arms
   A
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
C
 I don't mean it when I tell you
B
 That I don't love you anymore
Em
Look at that

Would you look at that?
A
The way the ceiling starts to swerve
Em          D         A          Em
What will I do when I don't have you
                             G    
When I finally get what I deserve?
G                               Bm      
From the housetops to the gutters
C                       D      C
From the oceans to the shores
    G                                      Em
The warning signs have all been bright and garish
C                           D
Far to great in number to ignore
G                          Bm
From the cities to the swamplands
C                        D     C
From the highways to the hills
    G                           Em
Our love has never had a leg to stand on
C                                          D
From the aspirins to the cross-tops to the Elevils
              C 
But I will walk 
D            G        C
down to the end with you
            G                D         G
If you will come all the way down with me
G                        Bm
From the entrance to the exit
   C                                  D     C
Is longer than it looks from where we stand
  G
I wanna say I'm sorry 
    Em
for stuff I haven't done yet
C                              D       
Things will shortly get completely out of hand
      G                           Bm
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
       C                     
In the tips of my fingers 
       D          C
in the skin on my face
       G                     Em
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
       C                                D
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place
             C        D
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
         G                    C
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell
        G               D G        C
I will walk down to the end with you
            G                D         G
If you will come all the way down with me
C
   the last white slabs of snow
F
   melted off seven weeks ago.
C
   and the geese are headed north again
F
   through the tightening sky,
          C                   G
and i can feel my heart in my throat again
C                            F
   new onions growing in the ground.
C
   the cows come gingerly out of the barn,
F
   and when they see that the ground is warm,
            C
they pick up a little speed, it makes me feel so good,
      F
and i feel it rushing down my throat -- fresh blood,
       C                       G
i head out onto the earth, its cold heart is melting,
C                        F
   i don't know if i can stand it.
             C                            G
springtime's coming, that means you'll be coming back around.
C                          F                   
   new onions growing underground, underground.
C                                       (D-B-E)
when i hear the screeching weather vane
C
in the wild wind and the hissing rain
            F
i know that one of us, i'm not saying who,
        C
has got rocks in her head
                                   G
as the rain comes through the open window
              F
but you don't think so
          C
i sure do love you
          C         (D-B-E)
i sure do love you
B C                       F
when I catch sight of your face
B C                          F
and the late light falling on it
B C                       G                  F              C
I feel scared and I scope the area out for a good place to hide
B C                       F
when I feel the way your fingers
B C           F
wiggle in my palm
B C                          F
I feel warm and I feel good inside
C                                 G
and I know that you're wearing a wire
C                                     F
but as the sun becomes a blazing orange ball of fire
         C                                G                  C
I lose interest in this and other such inconsequential questions
B C                   F
when you kick off your shoes
B C                          F
and I see the wet grass give way underneath your feet
B C                       G
and the sunset rears up once more to its burial ground
F              C
well, you look so sweet
(C)                              (G)
and I know you'll be turning me in
(C)                              (F)
but I also know your real name's not Amy Lynn
(C)                              (G)
and as the orange globe rears up to swallow us, too,
(C)                              (F)
I see you look at me and figure out what I know about you
                  (C)
well, I'm not telling
(G)               (C)
I'm not telling you anything
C           Am        F
If you really want to conjure up a ghost
C           Am             F                      G
Cultivate a space for the things that hurt you most
Am   C              F
Rake the sands until they surface
Em   C       F
Bind their tiny eyes
C           Am        F
Stake out your position, let your armor fall
C           Am             F                        G
Stay put til they find you, it won't take long at all
Am   C              F
Rake the sands until they surface
Em        C           F
Up they come, gone translucent
C        Am                  F
They're coming up no matter what
Am           Em          C   G   F
Fools rush in and the doors slam shut
C           Am        F
Ghosts of my childhood stay with me, if you will
C           Am             F                                 G
Find a place where there's water, hold you under til you're still
Am         C                     F
Rake the sands until they surface
Em      C                        F
Don't let anybody call them ugly
G                          D
I will rise from the swamp
Em                          C
Where they dumped my private plane
                    G            D  Em
I'll be clutching a life preserver
      C
In my teeth
           G            D
And I will find the highway
Em                    C
And I will flag down a truck
G                     D
Worry lines on my forehead
Em              C
Blank stare underneath
           G                D
And when I come back to town
          C              G
I'm gonna cast my burden down
                       D
A little worse for wear
C
Practically walking on air
G                   D
I will thank my ride
Em                    C
And claw my way back inside
                   G                        D
To the guts of the building where my enemies
Em                   C
Hide in the dark like roaches
           G                      D
And I will signal the camera crew
    Em                             C
And everyone will do what he's been trained how to do
      G                     D
Sweat dripping from my face
Em             C
As my moment approaches
           G                   D
Click your heels count to three
          C              G
I bet you never expected me
                       D
A little worse for wear
C
Practically walking on air
C                    
  Got up before dawn
F                           C       F       
  Went down to the racetrack
C                            
   Riding with the windows down
F                                    C           F      
   Shortly after your first heart attack.
Am                           C     
   You parked behind the paddock,
Am                          C       
   Cracking asphalt underfoot,
Am                           C
   Coming up through the cracks
             G                  C
Pale green things, pale green things
C                                         
   You watched the horses run their workouts
F                                          C       F       
   You held your stopwatch in your left hand
C                                      
   And a Racing Form beneath your arm
F                                         C              F 
   Casting your gaze way out to no man's land
Am                                  C       
   Sometimes I'll meet you out there
Am                 C       
   Lonely and frightened
Am                                    C
   Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves
             G                  C
Pale green things, pale green things
C
   My sister called at 3 AM
F                    C       F       
   Just last December
C
   She told me how you'd died at last, at last.
F                                           C                     F 
   That morning at the racetrack was one thing that I remembered                      
Am                                  C    
   I turned it over in my mind
Am                                  C    
   Like a living Chinese finger trap
Am                                  C    
   Seaweed in Indiana sawgrass
             G                  C
Pale green things, pale green things
C     G
Holt Boulevard
Dm               F
Between Gary and White
       C                           G
Hooked up with some friends at the Travelodge
F                        G
Set ourselves up for the night
C                     G
Carpenter ants in the dresser

Flies in the screen

It will be too late by the time we learn

What these cryptic symbols mean
      C           F
And I dreamt of a house

Haunted by all you tweakers with your hands out
        C                         F
And the headstones climbed up the hills
        C                         F
And the headstones climbed up the hills
C                     G
Send somebody out for soda
Dm                          F
Comb through the carpet for clues
C                      G
Reflective tape on our sweatpants
F                G
Big holes in our shoes
C            G
Every couple minutes
        Dm                        F
Someone says he can't stand it anymore
C                  G
Laugh lines on our faces
F                 G
Scale maps of the ocean floor
      C           F
And I dreamt of a camera
         C                       F
Pointing out from inside the television
        C                    F
And the aperture yawning and blinking
        C                         F
And the headstones climbed up the hills
Em   F             C
If anybody comes to see me
Em                 F              C
Tell them they just missed me by a minute
   Em     F              C
If anybody comes into our room while we're asleep
C           G          F         G
I hope they incinerate everybody in it
      C           F
And I dreamt of a factory
           C                   F
Where they manufactured what I needed
      C           F
Using shiny new machines
        C                         F

Guard my bed while the rain turns the ditches to mirrors

buy a vase of carnations from central Ohio

where the looking machine can't hear us

Deep in the night we dream of positions

there's a line for the phone in the hall

most wars end in the fall

  Wind out of Oklahoma this morning
A#             F       G        C  A#
Smelled like blood an smoke
                   F        G
And the crows discuss their future in the

branches of their Louisiana Live Oak
     A#       F          G

  Leaves are all aglow
A#                 F            G
And the branches brush the upper air

But the roots reach down to were the bad people go

And an old cardboard produce box for a cradle
   C          A#              F    G
I mashed some bananas in a coffee cup
         D                 F        G
And I fed you there at the kitchen table
C    A#              F      G
  Crows outside complaining about the

Finer points of local politics

Strange wind all full of new smells

Rust and fur and reception sticks

Gather jewels from graveyards, when I get home bury them again
Em    Am              F                 G                        C
Wonder if you'll ever get the chance to ask me why I turned you in
Em       Am               F               G                         C

Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Em          Am                F     G                         C
It's hard to tell gifts of the spirit from clever counterfeits

Sleepwalk through my days and mark the hours until these dark times fade
Em    Am          F              G                            Dm
Like a caterpillar crawling out along the surface of the blade
Em        C            G           F
And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed

Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Rummage through the gutter storehouse now

Saw the trucks roll out this morning, not sure when they're coming back again
Em       Am             F                 G                       C
Feel the prickings of my conscience in my chest every now and then
Em         Am               F           G                      C
Sometimes a great wave of forgetfulness rises up and blesses me
Em       Am                 F                G                 Dm
And other times the sickness howls and I despair of any remedy
Em        C            G           F
And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed

I'm going to raise a nice cold glass of water
    G
And toast the living and the dead

Who've gone before me and my head

They all are going to greet me at the station

Like gypsies they will dance around me and
                                G
The choral droning sounds their voices make will
D           G
Saturate the evening
     G             F                  C      G
When I get off the wheel I'm going to stop
    F              C             G
And make amends to everyone I've wounded
    G
And when I wave my magic wand
      C
Those few who've slipped the surly bonds

Will rise like salmon at the spawning

on the shores of a lake named after a late queen of england
Ab
i heard new rumors of war.
G
the sun was a red ball up in the summer sky.

i saw my sister standing in the doorway.

she had that look on her face that reminded me of you.

they were shifting the power again.

they always do this when i come home.
C       Ab     G      F

C
i tucked my shirt in, though i don't know why.
Ab
shielded my eyes from the light up in the sky
G
'cause it was shining, blazing, like a highway flare
F
in the incredibly impossibly dry air
C
i heard my mother call my sister to the kitchen again
Ab
and thought that everything was headed straight down the drain
G
they positioned themselves in strategic locations
F
i was beginning to lose my patience.

from all the way across the country in Palm Springs
C      D          C
i can hear you now
C  C/B  Am7 G

C                                G
your laughter tore through the New Jersey night
C                          G
and i can't stand it, but i'm alright
C                                G
stood out on the balcony and i took a look around
     C                                         G
and a bird you would've loved the sight of brought the sky down
C                                 G
and i could hear your voice ringing
C                           G
and i could hear you singing
C             D              G                    Em
from all the way across the country in Palm Springs
C      D          C
i can hear you now
C			     Dm	  F
You broke the doorknob off of the door, the door swung open easily
C			     Dm	  F
You sauntered in to the poorly lit store, and looked around lazily
          C			     Dm	   F
You stole every bit of candy they had inside, gobbled it all up greedily
	        C			       Dm		F
I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone, I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone
C 
we live high, our love gorges on the alcohol we feed it 
C
and it grows all fat and friendly, we have surplus if we need it 
       A7add9                F                     C 
we hold on as hard as we can, our knuckles are white 
C
we write letters to each other invent secrets to confess to 
C 
i learn foreign and exotic terms of endearment by which to address you 
       A7add9                   F                     C
we feed fresh fruit to one another we stay up all night 
             G                             F 
and i am healthy, i am whole, but i have poor impulse control 
              C                G 
and i want to go home, but i am home 
C 
we are strong, we are faithful, we are guardians of a rare thing
C
we pay close, careful attention to the news the morning air brings 
        A7add9       F                         C 
we show great loyalty to the hard times we've been through 
C
we are filled with riches and wonders, our love keeps the things it finds 
C 
and we dance like drunken sailors, lost at sea out of our minds 
         A7add9                  F                              C
you find shelter somewhere in me, and i find great comfort in you 
            G                             F 
and i keep you safe from harm, you hold me in your arms 
               C              G 
and i want to go home, but i am home 
C                           F                G
Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow
                      C F G
I can't live like this
C
And in the shower I am a sailor
F                   G                       C F G
Standing waiting, ready for the ship to list
Am
Everything looks burned up
          C
I'm too scared to look around
       F
Don't feel like going on but
           G
Come on, make a joyful sound
        C                     F
If you will believe in your heart
      Am                C
And confess with your lips
            F        G         C
Surely you will be saved one day
C                            F
Try to think of ways to fix myself
        G                       C F G
But everything ends in a cul-de-sac
C
The beast broke from the barn while we were
F                 G                          C F G
Sleeping, face it, face it, he's not coming back
Am
Don't see what the point is
    C
In even trying to fight
      F
Look for the bigger picture
          G
When I close my eyes real tight
        C                     F
If you will believe in your heart
      Am                C
And confess with your lips
            F        G         C
Surely you will be saved one day
Em                   Am
Look for the sign of Daniel
A#            Am
Consider the clues
F                  C
Wait as long as I have to
          G
For good news
C
Wake and rise and face the day
     F               G                        C F G
And try to stop the day from staring back at me
C
Busy hours for joyful hearts
     F            G                     C F G
And later maybe head out to the pharmacy
Am
Won't take the medication
          C
But it's good to have around
   F
A kind and loving god
               G
Won't let my small ship run aground
        C                     F
If you will believe in your heart
      Am                C
And confess with your lips

Surely you will be saved one day
C      Csus4           C
We got in your car and we hit the highway
C       Csus4          C
Eastern sun was rising over the mountains
           F
Yellow and blood red bits
       C                       Csus4                     C
like a kaleidoscope
C           Csus4                C
And flaming swords may guard the garden of Eden
C      Csus4               C
But we consulted maps from earlier days
               F
Dead languages on our tongues
                  C              Csus4               C
Holding on to our last hope
        F                  G
And the day was bright and fine
        F                            C             G
And the highway sign said, “San Bernadino welcomes you”’
C            Csus4    C
I checked us into our motel and filled the bathtub
C           Csus4            C
And you got in the warm warm water
         F
I pulled petals from my pocket
               C                    Csus4                     C
I loved you so much just then
C          Csus4             C
And it was hard but you were brave, you are splendid
C           Csus4    C
And we will never be alone in this world
          F          
no matter what they say
            C                    Csus4                         C
We’re gonna be okay              
         F      G
We were safe inside
        F                        C             G
and our new son cried, “San Bernadino welcomes you”
C                          Em
Fog lifts from the harbor, dawn goes down to day
   Am                              F
An agent crests the shadows of the nearby alleyway
C                       Em
Piles of broken bricks, sign posts on the path
Am                              F
Every moment points towards the aftermath Yeah
C, Dm, F (x2)

C                                Em
Sailors straggle back from their nights out on the town
Am                             F
Hopeless urchins from the city gather round
C                         Em
Spies from imperial China wash in with the tide
      Am                  F
Every battle heads toward surrender on both sides
         C              Am
And I am coming home to you
        F               C  G

And I am coming to you

If it’s the last thing that I do
C                        Em
Bells ring in the tower, wolves howl in the hills
Am                                F
Chalk marks show up on a few high windowsills
      C                                Em
And a rabbit gives up somewhere, and a dozen hawks descend
Am                            F
Every moment leads toward its own sad end Yeah
C, Dm, F (x2)

C                                Em
Ships loosed from their mornings capsize and then they’re gone
Am                             F
Sailors with no captains watch awhile and then move on
       C                              Em
And an agent crests the shadows and I head in her direction
Am                        F
All roads lead toward the same blocked intersection
         C              Am
And I am coming home to you

With my own blood in my mouth

And I am coming to you

If it’s the last thing that I do
    Em
I was driving up from Tampa

When the radiator burst

I was three sheets to the wind

A civilian saw me first
    Am
And then there was the cop
                                        Em
And then the children standing on the corner
     C                           B
Your love is like a cyclone in a swamp
                             Em
And the weather's getting warmer
      Em
I was getting out of jail

Heading to the Greyhound

You said you'd hop on one yourself

And meet me on the way down
      Am
I was shaking way too hard to think
                           Em
Dead on my feet about to drop
           C                          B
Went and got the case of vodka from a car
                                 Em
And walked the two miles to the bus stop
C B Em

    Em
Got on the bus half drunk again

The driver glared at me

Met up with you in Inglis

Thumbed a ride to Cedar Key
        Am
If we never make it back to California
                            Em
I want you to know I love you
       C                                 B
But my love is like a dark cloud full of rain
                                Em
That's always right there up above you
C                            Am
Long dinner with some friends
C                            Am
Way out way out in Portmore
C                            Am
Servants of he pharaoh 
F                           G
Slip in through the open door
         C           Am                 
All business
C                            Am
Bearing knives and zip-guns
C                            Am         
So get on the floor now 
F                        G
Every last one every last one
F               G           C      Am   G   F
The heat drifts across the land
F           G
If I forget Israel 
C             Am G     F
Let me forget my right hand
                  G            
I cut down that withered peach tree
A                      G        A
Just like you asked me to
                     G
And I hacked it into pieces
Bm                               A
Set it on fire with your face in plain view
       D                     A
At the near window where you stood
G                     D
Watching me split the wood
D                 A
I will do as I am told
G                    D
I will keep away the cold
A G 2x A

                    G
The fire pit in the snow
A                      G     
Gave off a rich bright orange-red glow
   A                  G
A familiar scent rose up into the air
      Bm                                  G
And I remembered something special from a long time ago
    D                   A
You opened up the door
G                     D
Stepped away from the killing floor
     D                                   A
Your footprint on the snow was fresh and new
G                          D
When you touched me I felt fire come through
D                 A
I will do as I am told
G                    D
I will keep away the cold
D                 A
I will do as I am told

bearing the Sicilian crest

We were parked in your car

In our neutral meeting place
    F            G
The Episcopalian church yard
C                       Am
I had things I had been meaning to say
           F               C
But in the dazzling winter sunlight
        F              G
I could feel them melt away

And through the warm radio static

I couldn’t hear my stage directions
        A#                    F            G
And the fog on the windshield obscured our sad reflections

I felt so desperate    Riff:

I saw the wild straw berries on the vine, out of control

Well I was trying to think of something clever
C                  F         G
you were saying nothing whatsoever

I saw the faries throw their hooks into the soil

I think of you from time to time

Making contact gets harder

I'm under no illusion
C        F           Am
As to what I meant to you
F                     C
But you made an impression

What I've misplaced but never lost

An ache I first felt long ago
Am                               C
Though you've appeared and disappeared

Throughout these past few years

When you were not the one in love?

Spring rain was misting down on Kingston.

And down at the harbor

Local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment.

  And for a while there it was chaos

  As they handcuffed and then ruffed up some sailors.

Once a week I make the drive

two hours east to check the Austin post office box.
C                      D5
I take the detour through our old neighborhood,

see all the Chevy Impalas in their front yards up on blocks,
       F                      G
and I park in an alley and I read through the postcards
          C               F
that you continue to send:
          D5                        F
where as indirectly as you can you ask what I remember.

I like these torture devices from my old best friend.

West Texas highway was a Möbius strip --

I could ride it out forever. When I feel my heart break,

I almost swear I hear it happen, it's that clear and that hard.
   C                             F
I come in off the highway and I park in my front yard.

walk the floors a little while.

I set the postcard on a table with all the others like it,
F                         G
start sorting through the pile.
F
I check the pictures and the postmarks
         G
and the captions and the stamps
     C                       F
for signs of any pattern at all.

When I come up empty-handed, the feeling almost overwhelms me.

I let a few of my defenses fall

and I smile a bitter smile - it's not a pretty thing to see --

Am                                    G
Like the clock that ticks in Dresden
Am                                    G
When the whole town's been destroyed
Am                                 G
Like the nagging flash of insight
Am
You're always desperate to avoid
Am                               G
Like the bloody-knuckled gunman
Am                             G
Still stationed at the breach
Am                                     G
Like that board game with the sliders
Am
And the children on the beach

Stay alive
Am                        G
Maybe spit blood at the camera
           Am
Just stay alive
Am             G
Stay forever alive

The winter's wet, and the summer's hot

Take a match in Puerto Rico, why not
Em                                                                                                            
Power and adrenaline flowing like amber

When the water runs high sometimes

Twitch, when the tide ebbs low

See the sights, maybe go downtown

Sometimes you get some heat, sometimes it follows you around
C G  F
I... I'm not gonna say what I came over to say to you, but
C                  G                      F
You were thinking along the same lines, and you let the words come ringing though
C                              G   F
I wouldn't've said that to you.    I wouldn't say it if they paid me to.
           C                   G                           F
You got no manners.  You got no manners at all. You got no manners.

You got no manners. You got no manners at all. You got no manners.
C                G                     F
I... I'm gonna try real hard, but I- can't believe that you're really gonna do it.

It's like one of those Chinese kites, flying in the wind, and then some kid with a shotgun sends a bullet through it.
C                               G                             F
I came here to say it, but I've done that before, and I would never have told you that I don't love you anymore.
           C                    G                         F
You got no manners. You got no manners at all. You got no manners.

You got no manners. You got no manners at all. You got no maaaaaaanners.

toward the end of our first year in las vegas
C
you looked up from your little corner
     G
and i saw that your face was getting a little brighter
        C
and you asked me is it really getting warmer
      G             D
or is it just me and then you started mumbling
C          A
unintelligibly
                   G D    G
so what are you saying  anyway?
G
i thought i heard bells ringing but then i remembered
          C
that i no longer knew what bells sounded like
G
i thought maybe we'd strike up a conversation
         C
till bad luck cruised by on his ten speed bike
     G               D
i got real cold and iii grabbed my coat
        C                     A
and i saw that the ringing was coming from your throat
             G    D    G
what are you saying  anyway?
F               C          A#                  F
You looked real calm as we made our way up the walk
F               C       A#                 F
There were lazy kisses, hands brushing and small talk
F            C     F                    A#
The moon was high, your smooth face was dry and the

kudzu.... grew
        F     C       F
and the stars fell on alabama
         C                   F
and your eyes filled up with lightning
              C       F      A#    F    C    F
and the stars fell on alaba- ma
F        C                   A#   F
The warm earth underneath us gave way
          C                        A#                        F
dry grass crinkled like paper as a breeze came in across the bay
           C
cold clean water nearby
F         A#
glimmered in your eyes
         F       C
and your pistol      (glistened)
        F     C       F
and the stars fell on alabama
         C                   F
and your eyes filled up with lightning
              C       F      A#

but if you think I'll take a bullet for you, you're dreaming!
C                          F             Dm                F
Across the Burnside Bridge before anyone shot their movies there
C                                         F            G
We hid from the whipping rain when we had run out of cocaine
C                      F              Dm               F
Dispatch down to Plaid Pantry, two on point and two on sentry

Ah, the joys that the lesser days bring make you throw back your heads and sing
F   G     C               F                               G
God bless all petty thieves with tins of oysters up their sleeves
C              F       C   G                               C   G  C
Feast when you can and dream when there's nothing to feast on

Across a different bridge today, over the river and down Broadway
C                                       F                     G
Feels so good to have you here, some of you will be dead next year
C                    F               Dm               F
I see your destinies above you, like angels who don't love you

Let them kiss you and hold you tight...as long as the money's right
F   G     C          F                                       G
God bless all my old friends, and God bless me, too - why pretend?
C              F       C   G                              C   G  C
Feast when you can and dream when there's nothing to feast on
Em            C        F              C 
God bless the guys from my old neighborhood
Em            C                            F           G      G5  G
Gone past the point where any blessings can do them any good
           C            F     Dm                      F
Attach the C4 where you must, disappear in a cloud of dust

But spare a thought for what it covers up, pour a triple and raise your cup
C                            F               Dm                      F
We were here once, me and my friends, but we destroyed all of the evidence
C                               F                     G
And vanished into the night, at least we got that one right
F                    G          C                 F   
God bless us, all of us, we who learn to shun the light

God bless all vampires every night

Feast when you can

Feast when you can

In the 5 minutes worth of lost time that I had
G                              D
when I was passed out on the supermarket floor
       G                   C
I saw you at the head of the heavenly chorus
G                       D G
and I heard your song ringing all through the store
G G D G

G                              C
In the 5 minutes when my broadcast got preempted
G                               D
I saw you touchdown you were no longer dead
         G                 C
I was happy to see ya I had lots of questions
   G                     D              G
but I put my hand to the wound in your head
      C                    G
ah the blood all of that blood
            C      E        C     D       G
all of that warm blood flowing freely from you
G                              C
In the 5 minutes when I was dead to the world
G                              D
in a place far away from my friends and my home
       G                   C
I saw you with a smile on your radiant face
G                        D                 G
amidst all of the cans and the glass and the chrome
G                        C
In those 5 minutes my signal was jammed
G                          D
the frequencies that I received were so pure
       G                           C
that I almost believed that the sight of the hole 
         G                         D     G 
in your skull was a thing that my heart could endure
C                       G
pale white moon shines down on colorado

hide my dirty secrets

down here in the shadows

where the quaking aspens

tremble in the snow

haul me up the hillside

hold me high and let me go
       A#                                   C
let me fall down through my own roof like a meteorite
        Dm                                 F
let the world and all its wonders leave me to my toys tonight
             C        F
and my ninty-six inch television screen
        C
let me die.
        G  F                   C
let me die surrounded by machines.
C                      G
high winds knocked the power out last night
Dm
but I've got my own supply here
F
all my windows blaze with light
C                                        
and the light spills through the windows 
G
to the empty plain below
Dm
finds nothing but some trees 
    F
and six fresh feet of snow
      A#                                     C
and I find a broadcast station that's signed off for the night
        Dm                            F
and the static floods the speakers in glorious black and white
             C        F
on my ninty-six inch television screen
        C
let me die.
        G  F                   C
let me die surrounded by machines.

 You bought me a rabbit

 To keep me company

 And the rabbit's here with me

 Heading out Highway One

 Respecting posted speed limits

C       G        Em      Am
I waited here all by myself
C            G                        Em     Am
The room was dark and it smelled like sulfur
C           G            Em              C
I heard the screams from way down in the darkness
C             G                   C
I felt pretty sure my life was over
C         G                 Em  Am
I kept my hat on just for luck
C              G                      Em      Am
And sang simple tunes the whole night through
C          G              Em             C
I wondered if I'd wake to find myself in flames
C    G               C
As I waited here for you
              G    C
Yeah when you came in

I could breathe again

I saw some guys dressed up like sorcerers
C               G                Em     Am
Blue robes that flowed above the ground
C             G              Em                  C
They came and went and I was frightened for my life
C       G              C
I tried not to make a sound
C            G            Em      Am
Just when my solitude was closing in
C         G                    Em   Am
I heard a howl like screeching tires
C          G                 Em             C
And I told you the one thing I knew how to say
C                     G              C
To the bright ringing drone of 8 bit choirs
              G    C
Yeah when you came in

I could breathe again

The best ever death metal band out of Denton

were a couple of guys, who'd been friends since grade school.
  C                           
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff
          F                                 G
and they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom.
     C

F                            G
         never settled on a name.
         C
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate,
              F                 G                            C*  F G
were Satan's Fingers, and The Killers, and The Hospital Bombers.
C* F G

          C 
Jeff and cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
     F                              G
for stage lights and Learjets, and fortune and fame.
        C 
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram,
        F                           G
they stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names.
   F                    G
This was how Cyrus got sent to the school 
            C                       F
where they told him he'd never be famous.
     F
And this was why Jeff, 
         G
in the letters he'd write to his friend,
C                  F
helped develop a plan to get even.
           C
When you punish a person for dreaming his dream,
         F                            G
don't expect him to thank or forgive you.
    C

    C                      G#                 Dm              F
The ghosts that haunt your building have been learning how to breathe
     C                 Em            Dm              F
They scan the hallways nightly vainly searching for a sign
      C                G#             Dm                     F
There must be diamonds somewhere in a place that stinks this bad
          C                     Em     Dm              F
There are brighter things than diamonds coming down the line
               C   C7   F/A
Here they come
          Dm        F
The young thousands
               C   C7   F/A
Here they come
          Dm        F
The young thousands
F
the rain fell all night
Bb
and it kept me awake
F
it was still falling by morning.
Bb
it was hard to take.
C
and you were sleeping on the floor,
Bb
breathing free and even,
F
if i ever want to drive myself insane,
Bb                            C
all i have to do is watch you breathing
F
and at 5 AM,
Bb
i turned the radio on,
F
and an old mans voice
Bb                 C
sang a short sweet song,
F
and then the static roared again
Bb
hungry for blood
F
i heard the rain falling from the rain spout
Bb
down down into the sweet wet mud,
C
and you punched out all the windows
Bb
and the wind began to wail
F
and you gathered your hair behind your head
Bb                                 C
like god was gonna catch you by the pony tail,
F
and then the old voice crackled through the static.
Bb
and i felt young and alive
F
and the hair stood up on the back of my neck
Bb                      C
we were rising from the grave, yeah yeah.
F         Am                  A#                  F
I broke free on a Saturday morning, I put the pedal too the floor
         F             Am              A#                F
Headed north on Mills Avenue and listened to the engine roar
F    Am   A#    F

F    Am   A#    F

                  F                       Am
My broken house behind me and good things ahead,
               A#                        F
a girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
                 F                       Am
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
       A#                  F
aha! listen to the engine whine
               F                    Am          A#      F
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me
               F                    Am         A#        F
I am going to make it though this year if it kills me

I played video games in a drunken haze,

I was seventeen years young

Hurt my knuckles punching the machines

the taste of scotch rich on my tongue

And then Cathy showed up and we hung out

trading swigs from a bottle all bitter and clean

locking eyes holding hands

twin high maintenance machines
Dm                              F
I drove home in the California dusk,
Dm                                   F
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Dm                                   F
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face,
A#                          C
ready for the bad things to come.

I down shifted as I pulled into the driveway,

the motor screaming out stuck in second gear

The scene ends badly as you might imagine

in a cavalcade of anger and fear

There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year
C                       F       Dm        A#   C
Cold through broken baseboards, I despise this town
C               A#   F               F G C
Snow on the sunroof, two stories down
C    F      C                 Dm
Hold hands, wish the snow away.
C               A#   F                    F G C
Rise in the darkness of the gathering day
Am    E          C            F
Sing, sing for ourselves alone
Am      E     C         F
Speak into the microphone.
C                    F     Dm       A#     C
Cedar smudge our headbands and take to the skies
C              A#    F                         F G C
Soar ever upwards on air gone black with flies
C                       F       C             Dm
Shroud ourselves in the cosmos, let the music play
C                       A#  F                      F G C
Bright star of the morning, shine on his rising way
Am          E    C                   F
Sing in the night in the nameless dark
Am          E   C                   F
Father long gone but we bear his mark
Em        F        G     C
Learn some secrets, never tell
Em  C     F         G
Stay sick, don't get well
C                       F       Dm       A#      C
Clutch those broken headboards, ride the highest wave
C              A#                 F                 F G C
Dusky diamonds shining in the far depths of the cave
C        F                C                Dm
Try to explain ourselves, babble on and on
C      A#          F                       F G C
By the time you receive this, we'll be gone
Am    E         C                     F
Sing, sing high, while the fire climbs
Am    E     C             F
Sing one for the old times
G                                                              F
you knew that they were out there by the signs they'd left behind
C
on old abandoned buildings just some xs and some lines
G                            F
half circles in the concrete crescents in the snow
C                                                                 Cm
you could find the little beacons almost everywhere you'd go
        Cm              F               Am                      C      
only people who were sick enough knew how to read them right
G                      D                  C
i got sick when I was seventeen and I'd hunt down signs all night
G                                  F
you'd listen for the voices in the generator's hum
C                                                              Cm
hang out behind the power plant and wait for them to come
G                                  F   
hints about their mission in the rustling of the surf
        C                                                              Cm
but no secrets can be kept from you if your faith is strong enough
        Cm              F              Cm                     C      Cm
only people who've been sick too long can hold on to the hope
G                                                              D             C               G
but some friendly ghost is listening to the prayers they learned to say at the slack end of the rope
C
You turned to me and asked me if I'd always be your boy
A#    F                  Fsus2
As we drove across the river into western Illinois
       C
And on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel
A#    F                  Fsus2
Wheels were spitting out sparks, scraping at the rails
D
Wind in your hair, alright
F
Sunset spilling through the rear window
C
Your white t-shirt hugging your shoulders
G
Beaded with sweat
C
On the day that I become so forgetful
F
That all of this melts away
G
I will burn all the calendars that counted the years down
F                   C
To such a worthless day
C
As we walked across the parking lot towards the motel office
A#   F               Fsus2
We were walking with a benediction on us
          C      
Light was everywhere, the building stood against the sky
      A#   F       Fsus2
Like a monument to desperation, two floors high
D
A mile and a half from the river
F
We went back to the car to get our overnight bags
C
Sunset spilling through your earrings
G
All over your body
C
When we shut the motel room door behind us
F
We knew we'd hit the motherlode
G
On the day that I forget you
F               C
I hope my heart explodes
C            Dm  D
Drawn to the dark
F                         Am         Dm
Covered by the blood when possible
Dm           Am       Abm
Call to the corners
Am
To any open crucible
C        Dm    D
Easy to reach
F                      Am       Dm
Bearing every mark unmissably
Dm                       Am             E           Am   F
Wanna leave behind some token of what I carried with me
Em             Dm             F
Search in the storm drains
      Em          Dm      F
Sleep in the underpasses
Em          Dm
Try hard to look hard
   F       Em           G
Behind my blackout sunglasses
           C            F
But I have high unicorn tolerance
       C             F
I have high unicorn tolerance
       C             F
I have high unicorn tolerance
       C             F
I have high unicorn tolerance
C              Dm       D
Swim with real sharks
F                          Am
Those who never speak when spoken to
Dm                    Am     Abm
Hard limits fade into memory
     Am
Once broken through
C            Dm   D
Scaling the well
F                Am
Every single day instinctively
Dm         Am
Feel shame real shame
            Abm                  Am
For what my friends must think of me
F   Em          Dm
Dig through the graveyard
F       Em               Dm
Rub the bones against my face
F            Em              Dm
It gets real nice around the graveyard
F           C            G
Once you've acquired the taste
Em           F                     C    C#  G
And when the clouds do clear away
     G                     C
Get a momentary chance to see
Em  Dm                             C
The thing I've been trying to beat to death
 F Em      G                     Em
The soft creature that I used to be
F Em       G          C
The better animal I used to be
C              Dm    D
Draw where I'm drawn
F                       Am
Seldom wonder why, just follow you
Dm                        Am
Never blame the rags that swallowed me
        Abm                  Am
For the place the river took me to
F    Em          Dm
Long life to the spiders
F     Em            G
Safe travels to the crows
F           Dm
Love to the ghosts
F             Em             G
Who taught me everything I know
           C            F
But I have high unicorn tolerance
       C             F
I have high unicorn tolerance
           C            F
But I have high unicorn tolerance

I have high unicorn tolerance
Dm        A#    C                 F      D#
Rain beats down, down on the outer walls
            A#                  Am
Down on the skylight, where the streetlights
Dm                     C     A#
Shine like unquenchable coals
Dm        A#    C                 F     D#
And I'm up high, trying to say goodbye
                    Dm
The only way I know how
          A#
Crude and graceless
F       D#          A#
Peeking through the eyeholes
A#
Seeing the real you
    F          Gm
And just after midnight
        A#                      F
When it feels like it's getting late

I will reveal you

I will reveal you
F   Fsus2   F

Dm          A#    C                  F    D#  A#sus2
Crowd's half-gone, just a few hangers-on
        Am            Dm                           C      A#
Come to see me finally tear through the stitching at last
Dm           A#             C                    F       D#
And you don't care, you look almost relieved down there
            Dm                A#
Like you're free, like you can breathe now
F            D#            A#
Like they've sawn off your cast
A#
Just one more sleeper to see through
    F         Gm
And by way of honoring
    A#                       F
The things we once both held dear

I will reveal you

Cast of thousands

But we were the real two

And when I'm alone
         A#             F
Before a mirror late at night
       C
I will reveal you
       Gm
I will reveal you
Am           G
Sunset on Snohomish

Burn the tree line down

Hold my hopes underwater

Stand there and watch them drown

Fishing out their bodies

From the bathroom sink

Leave them in a bucket

Until they start to stink

I think I'll stay here

I don't know when

Trout swim past the fishing lines

Sky gets dark and close

Cars start up and make

Their nightly exodus
Am                 G
On a picnic bench alone

Watch the sky go dark

Dig my nails into my hands

Hope it leaves a mark

I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside

And I steal down to Business 15-501

Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps

Heading vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes

I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face

Wild sage growing in the weeds
       C              F               C                 F
On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time

I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared

And I began to talk to myself almost immediately
          C       G         F           G          C
Not being used to being the only person there, mhmmm                               
    C                 F               C                       F
The first time I made coffee for just myself, I made too much of it

But I drank it all just cause you hate it when I let things go to waste
      C                    F                   Am              F
And I wandered through the house like a little boy lost in the mall
       C                  G               F               G
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space

And I sang

Oh, What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

What do I do without you?

      C                  G      F                    C
I was cold so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat
        C              F              Am              F
And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened
              C            G               F        C
I practically ran from the living room out into the street
        C             F                C              F
And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend
        C                 G                  C
And the world in its cold way started coming alive
      C                  F           Am               F
And I stood there like a business man waiting for the train
          C             G         C
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang
C             G             F             C
Oh, What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
C         G          C
What do I do without you?

Felt sick, felt good

I checked into a bargain priced room on la sienaga,
Dm                                    F        C
gazed out through the curtains of the parking lot.
                                            Am
walked down to the corner store just before nightfall in my bare feet.

and when I came back I spread out my supplies.
        F
on the counter by the sink, 
            G
I looked myself right in the eyes
                   C      F

I ducked behind the drapes when I saw the moon begin to rise,
Dm                      F                     C
gathered in my loose ends switched off the light.
                                                Am
and down there in the dark I can see the real truth about me.
  Dm           F                             C
as clear as day, lord if I make it through tonight

I use most of the time when I've got something on my mind

And I don't wanna squander the moment

Trying to come up with a better way to say what I want to say

You deserved better than you got

Someone's got to say it sometime because it's true.

People should have told you you were awesome,

And when we did we were right.

I hope the people who did you wrong

Have trouble sleeping every night.

Try not to lose sight of the mission
                      C
It never hurts to give thanks to the broken bones
                             Em7    B7 C
You had to use to build your ladder
Em7             B7
Moment close at hand
C
Half of you will never understand
                             Em7 B7 C
And it doesn't really matter
D               A
Big smile on my face
C
Capsule just in case
                   Em7 B7 C
Underneath my tongue
Em7            B7      C
Voices on the breeze
                         D                        Em7
I heard voices once like these when I was younger
G                    Em
Blood rushing to my face
C                       Bm
I know that sweet warm taste
        B
And the bitter trace
Em7                   B7    C
Storm right down that hill
                   C
If I don't, no one will
                                 Em7 B7 C
Follow me right through the chaos
Em7                   B7    C
This whole house is doomed
                       C
Even the big parts get consumed
                           Em7 B7
Prepare a grave for Menelaus
                  C
It never hurts to give thanks to the navigator
                                     Em7   B7 C
Even when he's spitting out random numbers
Em7                       B7     C
I knew what those figures meant
                             D
And what they hoped to represent
                 Em7 B7 C
When I was younger
G          C            G
He hit me right in the face.
G           C          D
I drove the Falcon uptown.
G                C          G     C
Hung out in the library parking lot.
G               D           G
The swelling'll never go down.
C                               G
Tied a Hiram Walker in the lining
G                              D
of my father's old corduroy coat --
G         C              G       C
big, big plans hatching in my brain and a
G         D            G
big ugly lump in my throat.
C G
I drove up to Harvey Mudd and I played pinball
G D
'til I didn't want to kill anyone.
G C G C
polished off all my cheap whiskey
G D G
and stepped out into the California sun.
G C G
Singing bainne na mbó is na ngamhna,
G C D
and the juice of the barley for me.
G C G C
Singing bainne na mbó is na ngamhna,
G D G
and the juice of the barley for me.
G C G
My thirst carried me up the coast,
G C D
where it only got sharper, God damn it,
G C G C
in a small room that got even smaller
G D G
a block away from the Wilamette.
C G
There was nowhere I needed to go,
G D
and nowhere I wanted to be.
G C G C
And my window looked out upon nothing,
G D G
and nothing looked right back at me.
C G
I had a couple of things on my mind,
G D
a couple of problems to think through,
G C G C
and I drank 'til I couldn't see straight anymore --
G D G
until there was nothing to drink to.
G C G
singing bainne na mbó is na ngamhna,
G C D
and the juice of the barley for me.
G C G C
singing bainne na mbó is na ngamhna,
G D G
and the juice of the barley for me.
